### ECMAScript 概述 ###

>* The following is an informal overview of ECMAScript—not all parts of the language are described. This overview is not part of the standard proper.

以下是ECMAScript一个非正式的概述，不包含所有部分。本概述不是标准的一部分。

>* ECMAScript is object-based: basic language and host facilities are provided by objects, and an ECMAScript program is a cluster of communicating objects. In ECMAScript, an object is a collection of zero or more properties each with attributes that determine how each property can be used—for example, when the Writable attribute for a property is set to false, any attempt by executed ECMAScript code to assign a different value to the property fails. Properties are containers that hold other objects, primitive values, or functions. A primitive value is a member of one of the following built-in types: Undefined, Null, Boolean, Number, String, and Symbol; an object is a member of the built-in type Object; and a function is a callable object. A function that is associated with an object via a property is called a method.

ECMAScript是基于对象的：基本的语言和宿主环境由对象提供，并且ECMAScript程序是通信对象的集群。在ECMAScript中，每一个对象是零个或多个属性的集合，属性决定了每个对象怎么使用，例如，当可写属性的属性设置为false时，可执行的ECMAScript代码的任何尝试分配不同的值属性将失败。属性包含其他对象，原始值，或函数。原始值是一个成员的以下内置类型：Undefined，NULL，Boolean，Number，String 和Symbol;对象是内置Object类型的成员;和函数一样，是一个可调用对象。与对象经由一个属性相关联的函数称为方法。

>* ECMAScript defines a collection of built-in objects that round out the definition of ECMAScript entities. These built-in objects include the global object; objects that are fundamental to the runtime semantics of the language including Object, Function, Boolean, Symbol, and various Error objects; objects that represent and manipulate numeric values including Math, Number, and Date; the text processing objects String and RegExp; objects that are indexed collections of values including Array and nine different kinds of Typed Arrays whose elements all have a specific numeric data representation; keyed collections including Map and Set objects; objects supporting structured data including the JSON object, ArrayBuffer, and DataView; objects supporting control abstractions including generator functions and Promise objects; and, reflection objects including Proxy and Reflect.
