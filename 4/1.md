### 概述 ###

>* This section contains a non-normative overview of the ECMAScript language.

本节包含ECMAScript语言的非规范性的概述。

>* ECMAScript is an object-oriented programming language for performing computations and manipulating computational objects within a host environment. ECMAScript as defined here is not intended to be computationally self-sufficient; indeed, there are no provisions in this specification for input of external data or output of computed results. Instead, it is expected that the computational environment of an ECMAScript program will provide not only the objects and other facilities described in this specification but also certain environment-specific objects, whose description and behaviour are beyond the scope of this specification except to indicate that they may provide certain properties that can be accessed and certain functions that can be called from an ECMAScript program.

ECMASscript 是一门在宿主环境内执行计算和操作对象的一门语言，但这里并不是说ECMAScript能自主计算，的确，在本说明书中对外部数据的输入或运算结果的输出中没有规定。相反，它预示着ECMAScript 不仅提供对象和其它在本说明书中的策略，还包含某些环境的特定对象。那些超出本说明书范围的，除了可以指示它们可以访问的某些属性，还可以指示它将被ECMAscript程序调用。

>* ECMAScript was originally designed to be used as a scripting language, but has become widely used as a general purpose programming language. A scripting language is a programming language that is used to manipulate, customize, and automate the facilities of an existing system. In such systems, useful functionality is already available through a user interface, and the scripting language is a mechanism for exposing that functionality to program control. In this way, the existing system is said to provide a host environment of objects and facilities, which completes the capabilities of the scripting language. A scripting language is intended for use by both professional and non-professional programmers.

ECMAScript最初设计用来作为脚本语言，但现在已成为作通用编程语言。脚本语言是用来操作，定制和自动化现有系统的设备的编程语言。在这种系统中，有用的功能是可以通过一个用户界面，脚本语言用于对该功能进行编程控制的一种机制。以这种方式，现有系统被认为是提供对象和设施的主机环境，从而完成脚本语言的能力。脚本语言是供给程序员使用。

>* ECMAScript was originally designed to be a Web scripting language, providing a mechanism to enliven Web pages in browsers and to perform server computation as part of a Web-based client-server architecture. ECMAScript is now used to provide core scripting capabilities for a variety of host environments. Therefore the core language is specified in this document apart from any particular host environment.
